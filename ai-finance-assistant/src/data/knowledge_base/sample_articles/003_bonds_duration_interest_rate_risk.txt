Title: Bonds, Duration, and Interest Rate Risk
Level: Beginner
Tags: bonds, duration, interest rates, risk

Bonds are loans to governments or companies. They often pay interest (coupon) and return principal at maturity.

Interest rate risk:
- When interest rates rise, older bonds with lower coupons become less attractive, so their prices often fall.
- When interest rates fall, existing bonds can become more attractive, so their prices often rise.

Duration is a measure of how sensitive a bond (or bond fund) is to interest rate changes. Higher duration usually means more price movement when rates change.

Key idea: bonds can reduce portfolio volatility compared to stocks, but bonds are not “risk-free.” Rate changes and credit risk can affect returns.

An emergency fund is money set aside for unexpected expenses (job loss, medical bills, urgent repairs). The main purpose is stability, not high returns.

Key properties:
- Liquid: easy to access quickly
- Low risk: minimize chances of losing value right when you need it
- Separate from long-term investing

A common guideline is holding several months of expenses, but the “right” amount depends on income stability, dependents, and risk comfort.

Title: Expense Ratios and Fees
Level: Beginner
Tags: expense ratio, fees, etf, mutual fund

Many funds (ETFs and mutual funds) charge an expense ratio: a small annual fee taken from the fund’s assets. An expense ratio of 0.10% means $1 per year per $1,000 invested (approximately).

Fees matter because they compound over time. Two funds with similar holdings but different fees can produce meaningfully different long-term outcomes.

Practical tip:
- If you’re comparing similar index funds, lower fees can be beneficial.
- Fees aren’t the only factor (tracking difference, liquidity, and tax efficiency can matter too).

Level: Beginner
Tags: stocks, etf, index, diversification

A stock represents partial ownership in a single company. When you buy a stock, your outcome is highly tied to that company’s performance and investor expectations.

An ETF (Exchange-Traded Fund) is a basket of assets that trades like a stock. Many ETFs track an index, such as a large-cap index. Because ETFs can hold many securities, they can offer diversification with a single purchase.

Common differences:
- Concentration: a single stock is concentrated; an ETF is usually diversified.
- Risk: single stocks can be more volatile; diversified ETFs can smooth outcomes.
- Fees: ETFs may charge an expense ratio (a small annual fee).
- Use case: ETFs are often used for broad exposure; stocks for targeted bets.

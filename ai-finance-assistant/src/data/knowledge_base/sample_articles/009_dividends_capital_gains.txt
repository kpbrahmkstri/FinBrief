Dividends are cash payments some companies distribute to shareholders. Capital gains occur when you sell an investment for more than you paid.

Two ways investors can benefit:
- Income: dividends
- Growth: price appreciation (capital gains)

Tax treatment can vary depending on country, holding period, and account type. The key concept is that returns can come from multiple sources, not just price changes.

Title: Rebalancing Basics
Level: Beginner
Tags: rebalancing, allocation, risk

Rebalancing means adjusting your portfolio back toward a target allocation. Over time, winners can grow to dominate your portfolio, increasing concentration risk.

Example:
- Target: 60% stocks, 40% bonds
- If stocks outperform, your portfolio may drift to 70/30
- Rebalancing might involve selling some stocks or buying bonds to move back toward 60/40

Rebalancing is a risk management behavior. It does not guarantee better returns, but it can help keep risk aligned with your plan.

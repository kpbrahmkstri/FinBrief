Title: Compounding and Dollar-Cost Averaging
Level: Beginner
Tags: compounding, contributions, DCA

Compounding is when returns generate additional returns. If you invest and earn a return, next period’s return applies to a larger base.

Dollar-cost averaging (DCA) is investing a fixed amount on a regular schedule (e.g., monthly). DCA can reduce the impact of buying all at once at a market peak, and it helps build consistent habits.

Important note: DCA does not guarantee profit, but it can reduce timing anxiety and create disciplined progress toward a goal.

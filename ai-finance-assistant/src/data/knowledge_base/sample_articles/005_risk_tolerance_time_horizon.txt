Title: Risk Tolerance and Time Horizon
Level: Beginner
Tags: risk tolerance, time horizon, allocation

Risk tolerance is how much volatility (ups and downs) you can emotionally and financially handle. Time horizon is how long you plan to keep the money invested.

General relationship:
- Longer horizon: you may be able to take more risk because you have time to recover from downturns.
- Short horizon: you may prefer stability, because you may need the money soon.

A helpful framework:
- Emergency fund: prioritize safety and liquidity.
- Near-term goal (1–3 years): limit exposure to high volatility.
- Long-term goal (10+ years): diversified growth assets may be more suitable.

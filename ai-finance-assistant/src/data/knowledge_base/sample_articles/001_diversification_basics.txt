Title: Diversification Basics
Level: Beginner
Tags: diversification, risk, portfolio

Diversification means spreading your investments across different assets so that a single loss does not dominate your entire portfolio. Instead of holding one stock, you might hold multiple companies across industries, or use diversified funds like index ETFs.

Why diversification matters:
- Company-specific risk: a single company can underperform or fail.
- Sector risk: an entire industry can be impacted (e.g., tech downturn).
- Market regime risk: different assets can behave differently during inflation, recessions, or rate changes.

A simple mental model: diversification reduces the impact of “bad luck” from any one investment. It does not eliminate market risk, but it can reduce volatility and help make outcomes more stable over time.
